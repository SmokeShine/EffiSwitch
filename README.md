3. Trend Analysis: Visualize daily productivity trends using interactive charts.

4. Insights: Gain actionable insights to improve focus and efficiency.

5. User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design for seamless usage. Click on panels to switch.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

1. React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

2. Chart.js: For rendering interactive and responsive charts.

3. Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend.

### Backend

1. Python: Primary programming language.

2. FastAPI: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs.

3. SQLAlchemy: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for database interactions.

4. PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source relational database system.

### Other Tools

1. Docker: For containerization and easy deployment.

2. Git: For version control and collaboration.

### Installation

#### Prerequisites

1. Node.js (for frontend)

2. Python 3.8+ (for backend)

3. PostgreSQL (for database)

4. Docker

#### Steps

Clone the Repository:

```
git clone <https://github.com/your-username/effiswitch.git>
cd effiswitch
```

Set Up Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following content:

```

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@db:5432/effiswitch

```

Replace user and password with your PostgreSQL credentials.

Build and Run the Docker Containers:

Run the following command to build and start the containers:

```

docker-compose up --build

```

This will:

1. Build the Docker images for the frontend, backend, and database.

2. rt the PostgreSQL database.

3. Run the FastAPI backend.

4. Serve the React frontend.

### Access the Application

Once the containers are up and running, open your browser and navigate to:

```

Frontend: <http://localhost:3000>

Backend API: <http://localhost:8000>

```

### Stop the Containers

To stop the containers, press Ctrl + C in the terminal where Docker Compose is running.

The docker-compose.yml file defines the services for the application:

```

version: '3.8'

services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
    env_file:
      - ./backend/.env.backend
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    # command: ./wait-for.sh db python app.py
    volumes:
      - ./backend:/app
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:80/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3

  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    env_file:
      - ./frontend/.env.frontend
    depends_on:
      - backend
    volumes:
      - ./frontend:/app
      # - /app/node_modules

  db:
    build: ./postgres
    env_file:
      - ./postgres/.env.db
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
      # - ./postgres:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U user -d my_database -h db"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

volumes:
  postgres_data:

```
